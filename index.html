            My first JavaScript project when I was learning web development.
            This was a really fun challenge at the time because it wasn't just
            another course or tutorial. Since then I've gone back to re-write it
            in TypeScript and make the code more modular. Looking back at this
            code makes me appreciate JSX a lot more.

          <p class="p-4 pt-1">
            This project was a take-home challenge as part of an interview
            process. Given designs and requirements, I had to implement the
            permutations algorithm and build this small, responsive application.
            After I joined the company, I learned that many interviewees thought
            the challenge was too difficult so it was replaced with an easier
            one.

            I wanted to practice what I learned in a course on Treehouse, so I
            built this rotating carousel. The user can rotate the carousel and
            turn over the individual cards, with some custom bezier curves for
            the animations to create a smooth experience.

            This is a small React app which calls PokéAPI to fetch and display
            data. I've experimented with implementing a cache,
            <code>useReducer</code>, <code>fetch</code> vs <code>axios</code>,
            and refactored the original app to TypeScript.

            To earn my first job as a Web Developer I built a portfolio site
            which included this game. I got a chance to work with
            <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> and had fun with collision
            detection. This gave me a small glimpse into the world of game
            development.
